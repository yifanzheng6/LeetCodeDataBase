## Question

Given a Weather table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.

| Id(INT) | RecordDate(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
|       1 |       2015-01-01 |               10 |
|       2 |       2015-01-02 |               25 |
|       3 |       2015-01-03 |               20 |
|       4 |       2015-01-04 |               30 |

For example, return the following Ids for the above Weather table:

| Id |
|----|
|  2 |
|  4 |


## SOLUTION

Cannot directly +1 or -1 on Date (won't correct when date is the first day or last day of a month)

```mysql
SELECT w.Id
FROM Weather as w, Weather as v
WHERE TO_DAYS(w.RecordDate)-TO_DAYS(v.RecordDate)=1
AND w.Temperature > v.Temperature
```
