## Question

Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.

| Id | Name  |
|----|-------|
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |

Table: Orders.

| Id | CustomerId |
|----|------------|
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |

Using the above tables as example, return the following:

| Customers |
|-----------|
| Henry     |
| Max       |

## Solution

When filter null, use IS NULL, instead of = NULL

 ```mysql
SELECT c.Name AS Customers
FROM Customers AS c
LEFT JOIN Orders AS o
ON o.CustomerId = c.Id
WHERE CustomerId IS NULL
  ```
