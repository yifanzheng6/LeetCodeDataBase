## Qustion

Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

| Id | Salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |

For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
|------------------------|
| 200                    |


## solution
KEY: FUNCTION

```mysql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      SELECT e.Salary  AS SecondHighestSalary
      FROM Employee AS e, Employee AS ec
      WHERE e.Salary <=ec.Salary
      GROUP BY e.Id
      HAVING COUNT(ec.Salary) = N
      
  );
END
```
